# Project Euler 067 - Maximum Path Sum II

By starting at the top below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3

7   4

2   4   6

8   5   9   3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in `numTriangle`, a 2D array containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.
